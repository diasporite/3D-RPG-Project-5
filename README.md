# 3D-RPG-Project-5
 
An experiment I've worked on between Sep 2022 and Dec 2022. The aim was to experiment with time slowing mechanics in combat. I have no plans to update the project, but I am using things I've learnt whilst working on this in future private Unity projects.

Character models from Adobe Mixamo.
